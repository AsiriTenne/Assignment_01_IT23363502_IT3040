📝 Singlish ➜ Sinhala Translator
Automated QA Suite

Assignment 01 | IT3040 | IT23363502

🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains a professional-grade automated testing framework built using Playwright.
The target application under test is SwiftTranslator, a real-time Singlish-to-Sinhala translation web application.

The objective of this project is to rigorously validate the translation engine’s accuracy and UI behavior across 38 distinct test scenarios, ensuring:

Correct linguistic translations

Proper handling of edge cases

Stable and responsive user interface

📊 Understanding the Test Results

In Quality Assurance, a failure doesn’t always mean bad news — sometimes it means the tester did their job perfectly 

✅ PASSED (Green Tick)

The application is stable

The translated output matches the expected Sinhala result

❌ FAILED (Red Cross)

🎯 Bug successfully identified

The translator produced an incorrect or linguistically invalid output

Confirms that the test script is effective

Note:
In this project, a Red Cross often indicates success from a QA perspective — it proves that the automation suite is capable of detecting translation issues accurately.
